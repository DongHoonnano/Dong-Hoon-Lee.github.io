            <h1>Dong Hoon Lee</h1>
            <p>Ph.D. candidate/ABD at UIUC</p>
            <p>I am Dong Hoon Lee, currently a final-year Ph.D. candidate(ABD, anticipated graduation date/Fall 2024) at the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign(UIUC). I obtained my master's in Bioengineering at the UIUC and Bachelor's in Life Science at Gachon University, South Korea. Prior to joining ABE department at UIUC, I served 3-years alternative military service(Technical Research Personnel) at Seoul National University Hospital, and the Institute for Basic Science, South Korea as a Research Staff. I am currently investigating an organic-material based, next generation nanozyme and its implementation in optical sensing platform for agricultural and biological applications. I am an elected fellow at the Royal Society of Arts and elected member at the Royal Society of Biology.</p>
